Solutions to exercises in the second edition of The C Programming Language by  
Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

## Purpose
1. Demonstrate my proficiency in C programming.
2. Share with those interested my personal solutions to the exercises in the  
much lauded book on C programming.

## Compiling Programs
gcc on the command line was used for compilation. 

## Testing Programs
Programs were developed in a Windows 10 environment. While some can simply be  
run and validated by observing the output, others required input redirection.  

Example of input redirection in PowerShell:
''get-content exercise1-9.c | .\exercise1-9.exe''
